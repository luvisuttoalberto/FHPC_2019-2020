Optimization Techniques
Positive also that there are parallelized versions of the same library so you get parallelization almost for free

What is available ?
Scalapack is a version of lapack for parallelization (scalability); same operation of lapack but can be run with a parallel approach

BLAS history (2/3)
OK for vector machines, but not for machine with caches is because of the large use of memory

A few notes:
If multithreading is abilitated watch out: it could be that I have 24 threads for each mpi process!! Use OMP_NUM_THREADS; if you run 12 processes just say OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 (per esempio). In the end, is it better to have 24 MPI with one thread or 1 MPI process with 24 threads? TRY!!
