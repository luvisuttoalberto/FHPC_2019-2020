I/O benchmarking
The second column is for parallel machines

I/O microbenchmark to play
Mdtest is for metadata performance

IOR basic usage
number of tasks here is 3

See title slide distinction usage of -F flag
Reason for large difference in the reading and writing: buffers!! The file system saves some of the file written on a buffer, so when you read it it's much faster
But in this way I'm not measuring the real speed of the dile system for reading: I need to avoid this!!

How fast are the metadata?
Lustre is the lower! The one on top could be a normal file system
Lower because there I'm asking to a machine that is on the net so lot of overhead! In the first case i have direct access to the part of the machine that do this

[Don't concentrate a lot on Darshan]
