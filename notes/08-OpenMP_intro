In our computer we have this architecture (probably), we don't have different banks of memory

OpenMP basic loop
Since i must be private, and I say implicit none, I must say that i is private and the other ones shared
As a default, the variable of the for (the counter) is private for every thread. Here I am only saying it explicitely
sum is shared too; mess up if not specified!

Specializing execution in PR
With binop we mean something like += or *=

Solving the reduction /4
check if here he fixed the code adding the parallel for

OpenMP work assignment in loops
Normally the default schedule is static

Clauses in parallel for
Normally, if you have nested loops, it is convenient to put the pragma parallel for only on the external one; in this way you can reduce the open and close openmp operations
As an alternative, you can use collapse (search)
Something about the level of complexity
For example, you have this:
for(i<Nr){
	for(j<Nc){
		M[i][j]...
	}
}

If you ask to collapse the compiler probably does:
for(k<Nr x Nc){
	k=i*Nc+j
}

Something like that (the compiler is able to perform this)

“touchfirst” policy
NB: check if he changes this to malloc (he should, with calloc the memory is initialized at the moment of allocation)

Threads affinity - BINDING [122]
check for error, the third one should be proc bind

OpenMP tasks [170]
Note that task it's not a nested region. You are not creating new threads!!
