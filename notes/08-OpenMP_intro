In our computer we have this architercture (probably), we don't have different banks of memory

OpenMP basic loop
Since i must be private, and I say implicit none, I must say that i is private and the other ones shared
As a default, the variable of the for (the counter) is private for every thread. Here I am only saying it explicitely
sum is shared too; mess up if not specified!
