The global initialized variables are in the data segment
stack is for local temporary variables
heap is for dynamic allocation (sometimes global)

There is always a pointer pointing to the memory where we can find the next instruction; in this way we can interprete that memory as an operation (for example)
Level 1 cache is separated in data cache and instruction cache, which is NOT the same as registers [maybe level 0]

"alloca" is a function to allocate memory space in the stack, for example when you don't know the size of the array from the beginning
