File View basic example (and usage)
Here I'm doing the same thing i was doing before!! It's reading one integer at a time (MPI_INT, MPI_INT)
If we wanted for example to do the ode for the aess of using file views, we SHOULD USE mpi DATA TYPE (fix things here)
We have to construt a data type that says that the first block is the used one and then we have 3 empty blocks (according to the first process)
