Serial applications are needed for example when you have to run a lot of times the same program

5
This is only for HPC providers

6
Manageability: you want to make the machine usable by the user through a front end (preferibly always the same one)
2: We want to improve the cluster without changing the interface

7
LRMS = Local Resource ManageR Service [/Software], also known as batch system

8
NTP needed for syncro
NFS Network file system, needed to have the impression to work on a single computer

14
Preemption: stopping a program to run another one (maybe more important or one that has priority)
Dependencies: a job that needs another job to end before beginning to work

16/17/18/19/20 not really necessary

26
ppn are processors (cores); here I'm asking 1 node with 2 cores

45
Here we prepend instead of appending so that when we compile we are sure to look into this directory first; in this way we are sure that we are using the right version of the program
Note that the path is not defined permanently, when you log out and log in again you have the same initial path unmodified, unless you use a specific command
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is the list of directory where the compiler looks for when executing a program that uses dynamic libraries

47
We will use make as user, not as developers; complicated
Autotools is even more complicated
Cmake is the most recent one

48
Install openblas library

49
Usually large and old projects comes in this way.
Note that usually executables go in /path/to/install_dir/bin, while libraries go in /path/to/install_dir/lib

50
Easier than autotools
We will for sure use make (for openblas and hpl) and probably autotools

51
Note that we can have intel tools for free for one year, go download it

52
Dynamic libraries also called Shared libraries
Different versions can also lead to a hidden error: maybe the compiler doesn't launch an error, but the numbers at the end of the program are wrong
NB: always comment with the libraries (and their version) you use on your code

54
Skip, will done later
