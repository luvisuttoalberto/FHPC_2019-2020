Obv if the barrier take a lot of time executing it means that there is a load balancing problem (Barrier is useful in this way)

NB error: in broadcast there is no rank: you just specify the communicator

Broadcast is blocking

Reduce work on one single processor ("receiver"); in the example, it's like if Sa and Sb would have been put only in P0 (if I chose P0 as the root in the function)
It's always better to use a different buffer as the receiver; allocate a new one everytime, otherwise you overwrite the sender one (not very good operation)
USE REDUCE IN THE ASSIGNMENT for the final sum of all the local sums
USE ALSO scatter and gather
You can also include the exercise in the assignment
NB: read is from a file for the exercise; you read the size of the array, then we fill the array with random numbers in the program
NB: don't count the input/output operations time (printf) in measuring the time of the algorithm
