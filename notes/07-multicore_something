Hyper threading (HT):
Hyper threading can improve performances because we are basically using two threads, doing different things, at the same time on the same core.
In general HT is not really good for HPC because usually in HPC different threads do the same thing; it is useful only if they do different things.

Opteron .....
Note that here we have 4 numa zones [=regions], with 2 sockets! Watch the links between group of cores within the same socket. So it's not always true that the number of numa zones is the same as the number of sockets.
