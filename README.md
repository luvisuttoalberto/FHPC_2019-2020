# <div class="text-red">  NEWS ABOUT EXAMS and person-to-person meeting 

Due to the current situation, it is still unclear when it will be possible to have a "normal" exam session.
Such a session will be set as soon as possible. **Meanwhile, we keep the open one, scheduled on February 13th, only to register the accepted final marks**, since in principle we could hold the examinations via skype.

We would strongly prefer **not** to have oral exams via skype: then, we will iteratively try new dates for the exams so that to have a proper exam session in March at latest.
Shall that not be possible, we will open a session and schedule you for an exam in person by appointment (with all due precautions as advised by the University, of course).

**SIDE NOTE** detailed notes about your 3rd assignments will be sent individually upon request

So:
1. if you accept the final mark that we have proposed, **enroll for the current session** and your vote will be registered
2. if you want to have an oral exam, pls be patient
3. if you want to have an oral exam *and* you can not wait any longer because of some deadline, write us and we will arrange that.

# Foundations of HPC, 2019/2020

## -- DSSC -- Data Science and Scientific Computing --

------



Welcome to the "Foundations of HPC" course at DSSC Department of the University of Trieste.

The scope of the course is to give you:

- an introduction to basic concepts of the High Performance Computing
- an introduction to the modern computer architecture and the techniques to exploit it to maximize performance
- an introduction to parallel/multi-threading programming with MPI and OpenMP
- an introduction to basic and advanced techniques for code optimisation for single- and multi-threaded codes

### Lectures

There will be 77 hours of lectures, on Monday and Friday, in "Aula D" in the basement of SISSA Building, at the Miramare campus.
The lectures will be structured as follows:

|        | 9.30-11.00 | 11.00-11.30 | 11.30-13.00 | 14.30-15.30 | 15.30-17.30                       |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Monday | first part | break       | second part | exercises   | free exercises + Office Hours (*) |
| Friday | first part | break       | second part | --          | --                                |

(*) *both S. Cozzini and L. Tornatore will be in Aula D for counselling, questions and chats about the course topics*

The lectures will be held starting from Friday 11th, October.
In the following days the lessons will be suspended:
Nov, 1st; Dec, 20th. 

After the Christmas break the lectures will re-start on Friday, 10th Jan and will end on Friday, 17th Jan.


### Exam

The marks range from 0 to 30, 18 being the minimum to pass (all the marks must be at minimum 18).

#### For people able to send the assigmements:
 - The final proposed mark will be made up by the weighted sum of the marks obtained in 3 home assignments that will be given along the course.
  - in case you wanted to improve your final mark, you could ask for an oral examination (maximum improvement is 5 point out of 30). That is at your own risk. Normally, if your oral examination goes through smoothly, you will only improve your result and you won't achieve a mark lower than what you already had. However, should you perform terribly, convincing us that your previous marks were not really related to your personal work, your mark could be put at risk.
 
#### For all the other (including previous' years student) 

 - There will be a written exam consisting in about 15 questions covering all the topics mentioned during the lectures. 
 - Students who pass the written exam will be asked to prepare some exercises (assigned by us) than must be submitted **within 15 days** from the date of the written exam. 
 - Once the exercise has been submitted an oral exam must be sustained, still  **within 15 days** from the date of the written exam.
 - If exercises are not submitted and/or oral exam failed the all exam should be repeated ( written/exercise/oral).
  


#### ASSIGNEMENTS:
3 written exercises will be assigned, with a strict due date. Failing to submit the solutions, unless for serious reasons of non-academic nature, will deny the access to the final exam.

The assignments's schedule will be the following:

- Oct, 28th --> due date: Nov, 4th     [ 30% of the final mark ]
- Nov, 29th --> due date: Dec, 16th    [ 30% of the final mark ]
- Dec, 16th --> due date: Jan, 10th    [ 40% of the final mark ]


#### FINAL TEST:
The final written test will
